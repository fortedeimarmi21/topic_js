<p>The standard for JavaScript is <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources">ECMAScript</a>. As of 2012, all <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/" class="external" rel=" noopener">modern browsers</a> fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org" class="external" rel=" noopener">ECMA International</a> published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently <a href="https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/" class="external" rel=" noopener">ECMAScript 2020</a>.</p>
